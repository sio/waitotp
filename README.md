# Listen for a valid TOTP token and exit

This small program will wait for a valid TOTP token to be sent on a TCP port
and then will exit. This is useful for guarding low traffic single-user
services on Internet.

## Service lifecycle (systemd)

- Guarded service startup is delayed by a call to [waitotp], this is achieved
  by overriding parts of the unit file (see [waitotp.conf] for example)
- [waitotp] listens on guarded service port but does not expose the service
  itself and does not reply to any incoming packets
- If a valid TOTP token is received, [waitotp] exits and lets the guarded
  service to proceed with startup
- Immediately after guarded service becomes active, systemd launches the
  related [inactivity-@.service]
- [inactivity.sh] tracks network usage of the guarded service and if it is
  inactive for a specified amount of time, [inactivity-@.service] restarts
- Systemd triggers a restart of guarded service unit which again ends up
  asking for a TOTP token before proceeding
